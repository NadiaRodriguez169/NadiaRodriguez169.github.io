        <p class="lead mb-4">I grew up in sunny Torrance, California, near the south bay beach cities. As this was my main area of inhabitance, I fell in love with all aspects of nature; water, trees, the bright sun and it's reflection on the cold California current. I find my peace in natural settings, playing music, and just feeling the sun warm my skin, and the wind blowing through my hair. I often traveled to Mexico throughout my childhood, so I gained much knowledge and cultural awakening through traveling all parts of Mexico. In my free time, I enjoy sewing, usually small crafts; like t-shirts and skirts for my stuffed animals. I love dancing as well, learning k-pop dances, TikTok dances, or even dancing to music I listen to. Zodiac signs and astrology have always been vital to how I perceive myself and others, our weaknesses, and strengths. As of now, music carries me through life, the good and the bad, or the everyday moods. I believe music manifests emotions and express myself through singing or through the lyrics I hear or feel.

Professionally, I have worked a couple jobs in the food industry and have gained years of knowledge in customer service. From preparing food to cashiering, I have held many responsibilities. Additionally, I spend time every year participating in volunteer work such as Christmas Toy and Food Drives. With a slight experience in marketing as well through charity and volunteer work. However, I have now switched my career path to focusing on helping others.
<br><br>

        

I am now in my second year of studying Psychology at the University of California - Riverside. Through my experiences in life as a queer Latina woman growing up in a dominantly Asian community, I have a broad understanding of many different cultures and people. My dedication to the psychology field is reciprocated through my work as I build my knowledge of human behavior and thought processes. 

Further, as my strength in punctuality displays my disciplined nature, it reflects my respect for others' time and my commitment to fulfilling responsibilities. Whether it is a class, a job, or a casual hangout with friends, I always strive to be on time and usually end up early. This timeliness was learned through my 5 years spent on my dance time in high school. I was always taught, if you are early, you are on time, if you are on time, you are late, and if you are late, good luck. I stand by this mindset and always make sure to respect others' time and space, which are key aspects to providing excellent service.

In combining my studies in psychology with my work experience and personal hobbies, I am working on shaping myself into a well-rounded individual. My career-oriented skills, commitment to punctuality, understanding of others, respect and diverse interests/background contribute to my overall growth and balance. With my blend of academic focus, professional experience, and creative hobbies, I believe I a bright future ahead, and that will be in the field of psychology.<br><br>
